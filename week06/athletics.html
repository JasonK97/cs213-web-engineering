            <h2>The Nation's Best Soccer Program</h2>
            <p class="overview">We ain't saying that we win every game, or that 
                we have the best fan turnout, but being based out of the Greater 
                Seattle area we recruit players from all over the Northwest, which 
                is notorious for producing some of the best soccer players around. 
                We provide a fun environment where our players can improve their 
                skills on the pitch, as well as find a place to relieve stress 
                from their academic endeavors.</p>

            <h4>Almost Ranked Football Team</h4>
            <p class="overview">With great athletes coming around, we offer not 
                the best football team around, but the most artistic at least. 
                With a focus on art and technology, we can't rely on recruiting 
                the best of the best as easily as we can for our soccer program. 
                While we may not have a conference ranked football team, we do 
                pride ourselves on providing a great environment to experience 
                Division One sports every weekend, and the fact we have never 
                been bottom of the seed.</p>
